/*
Instructions for Running Code:

For non-Extra Credit:
Please run:
FullPlaylistException.java
FullPlaylistListException.java
OutOfBoundsException.java
PlayList.java
PlaylistContainer.java
PlaylistOperations.java
PlaySong.java
SongRecord.java

This is due to how the PlaylistOperations file is written, since it refers to
FullPlaylistListException.java, PlaySong.java, and FullPlaylistException.java.

To see how the code works normally, compile all of these files and then run
PlaylistOperations.

NOTE:  For Extra Credit 01:
Please compile all the above files.  When testing, please insert a .wav file
within the same folder as these files.  This is due to the code importing a URL
class.  To add a song with a song file, press 'L' or 'l' and follow the
instructions.  You should not put quotation marks around the file name of the
.wav file.  To see if it plays, press 'O' or 'o' and enter the position of the
song entered.

NOTE:  For Extra Credit 02:
Please compile all the above files.  The instructions are similar to the
homework requirements for parameters.

NOTE:  All of the extra credit functions are clearly labeled in the menu.
NOTE:  If you need to contact me concerning the extra credit files, my email
is ryan.aday@stonybrook.edu.
